      <h2>Boosting vs. Effective Advertising</h2>
      <p>
        Boosting a post involves investing a certain amount of money to increase the post's reach and visibility to a wider audience. However, this method has its limitations, particularly when it comes to targeting specific audiences. Boosted posts are shown mainly to those who already like your page, resulting in a minimal impact and failing to reach the potential patients who could benefit from your services.
      </p>

      <h2>The Downfalls of Boosting</h2>
      <ul>
        <UnorderedListItem>
          <strong>Limited Audience Reach:</strong> Boosted posts only reach a small fraction of your total audience. This severely limits your practice's potential to connect with new patients.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        
        <UnorderedListItem>
          <strong>Ineffective Targeting:</strong> Boosted posts lack the advanced targeting options available in Facebook Ads Manager. This means your message might not be reaching the right demographics or potential patients.
        </UnorderedListItem>
        
        <UnorderedListItem>
          <strong>Budget Drain:</strong> While boosting can seem cost-effective, the limited reach and impact often lead to wasted marketing dollars and unsatisfactory results.
        </UnorderedListItem>
      </ul>

      <h2>Unlocking the Power of Facebook Ads Manager</h2>
