        Today, we're diving headfirst into TikTok—weighing the pros and cons of deploying TikTok ads versus crafting authentic TikTok posts for your orthodontic practice. Buckle up, imagine you've got the tech-savvy spirit of a teenager . . . <strong>and let's plunge into the world of TikTok!</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>The Power of TikTok Marketing</h2>

      <p>
        In this ever-shifting landscape of digital marketing, TikTok has risen to dominance, boasting a user base that could fill a small country and engagement rates that outshine the stalwarts of Facebook and Instagram.
      </p>

        alt="Average time spent on TikTok" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <p><em>The million-dollar question?</em></p>

      <p><strong>How do orthodontists tap into this juggernaut to get more new patients?</strong></p>

      <p>
        The dilemma is real—should your focus be on creating TikTok posts or investing in TikTok ads to grow your practice?
      </p>

      <p>We'll compare the two strategies below…</p>

      <h2>What is a TikTok Post?</h2>

      <p>
        At the heart of TikTok lies the "TikTok Post," the atomic unit of content on the platform—a brief video lasting anywhere from 15 to 60 seconds. These snippets, however, come with constraints…
      </p>

      <p><strong>…no external links and no control over who lays eyes on your creation.</strong></p>

      <p>
        Sure, anyone can toss content onto TikTok for free, but herein lies the challenge…
      </p>

      <p><em>…how do you ensure your potential customers not only see your post but also take the desired action?</em></p>

      <p>
        And here's the kicker: even if someone stumbles upon your post, does that translate into them becoming a patient?
      </p>

      <p>
        While posting on social media can be a hobby, as a business owner, your goal shouldn't be just to entertain people on social media – it should be centered around growing your practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, let's circle back: Does the seemingly <em>"free"</em> content you're dropping on TikTok truly contribute to the expansion of your orthodontic empire?
      </p>

      <p>Let's dissect this question further.</p>

      <img 
        src="https://startorthoboost.com/wp-content/uploads/TikTok-Ads-gif-compressed.gif" 
        alt="TikTok Ads" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <h2>How a Potential Customer Sees a TikTok Post</h2>

      <p>
        When a potential customer opens the TikTok app, your post gets a shot at the limelight on their coveted <em>"For You"</em> page. This digital stage is curated by TikTok's algorithm, showcasing content tailored to users' interests.
      </p>

      <p>To secure a prime spot, your post needs to check a few crucial boxes—it must be…</p>

      <ul>
        <UnorderedListItem>Engaging</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>Relevant</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>Entertaining</UnorderedListItem>
      </ul>

      <p>…and in tune with the latest trends.</p>

      <p>
        If your post doesn't embody these qualities, there's a solid chance it might just drift into the vast sea of overlooked content . . . <strong>with potential customers none the wiser to your orthodontic brilliance.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Orthodontists Who Have Mastered TikTok Posting</h2>

      <p>
        Now, let's shine a spotlight on those orthodontists who've cracked the TikTok code and turned content creation into a patient acquisition art form.
      </p>

      <p>Three standout examples are:</p>

      <ul>
        <UnorderedListItem><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sonrisasorthodontics">Sonrisas Orthodontics</a></UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thebentist">The Bentist</a></UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thebracesguy">The Braces Guys</a></UnorderedListItem>
      </ul>

      <img 
        src="https://startorthoboost.com/wp-content/uploads/sonrisasorthodontics.png" 
        alt="Sonrisas Orthodontics" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <img 
        src="https://startorthoboost.com/wp-content/uploads/thebracesguy.png" 
        alt="The Braces Guy" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <img 
        src="https://startorthoboost.com/wp-content/uploads/thebentist.png" 
        alt="The Bentist" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <p>
        These pioneers have not just mastered the art of posting but have garnered millions of followers and views. It's crucial to note, though, that while their content resonates with a massive audience…
      </p>

      <p>…only a fraction of those viewers reside in their local markets…</p>

      <p><em>…and an even smaller percentage might be actively seeking orthodontic treatment.</em></p>

      <p>
        You'll notice that most of the content on these accounts lean heavily towards entertainment. While this boosts shareability and views . . . it doesn't necessarily pave a straightforward path for conversion.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a potential patient stumbles upon your video, they're left with the cumbersome task of navigating the journey from viewer to scheduled appointment—figuring out who you are, where your office is, and how to initiate the scheduling process.
      </p>

      <p>
        While a highly motivated potential customer might endure this digital labyrinth . . . <em>the process isn't exactly a walk in the park.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        It's safe to assume that with millions of views, you'll likely get some local patients…
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>However, if your audience is small or your content isn't resonating, the odds of converting TikTok views into tangible new patients dwindle significantly.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>How Much Do TikTok Posts Cost?</h2>

      <p>
        So, here's the deal: posting to TikTok is free…
      </p>

      <p>…but that doesn't mean it won't cost you a dime.</p>

      <p>
        Take a glance at the top-performing TikTok orthodontists, and you'll notice a common thread—slick production.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it's staff showcasing dance moves or engaging in skits, these videos all appear to have professional lighting or camera work. These videos often undergo meticulous editing and post-production to ensure their success.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's be real, creating content of this caliber isn't as simple as just hitting the "post" button. It might involve:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <UnorderedListItem>Purchasing additional equipment</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>Compensating staff for their on-screen prowess</UnorderedListItem>
        <UnorderedListItem>Hiring a videographer or editor</UnorderedListItem>
      </ul>

      <p>…or investing your own valuable time in planning and execution.</p>

      <p>
        So, while the act of posting itself might be cost-free . . . <strong>the journey to that post involves a significant investment of either time or money.</strong>
      </p>

      <img 
        src="https://startorthoboost.com/wp-content/uploads/Videographer-scaled.webp" 
        alt="Videographer" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <h2>What is the Return on Investment for TikTok Posts?</h2>

      <p>
        If you've got the social media prowess to amass a substantial following and rack up views, TikTok posting could be your golden ticket to a commendable return on investment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your total cost would include the time spent, plus the monetary outlay for equipment and personnel. If you're adept at churning out captivating, entertaining content for social media, this avenue is undoubtedly worth exploring.
      </p>

      <p><strong>However, let's face facts…</strong></p>

      <p>
        The majority of orthodontists <em>(including yours truly)</em> aren't natural-born viral content creators. <strong>Achieving virality is like catching lightning in a bottle—an exhilarating experience that's elusive for most.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if you manage a viral hit once, repeating the feat becomes increasingly challenging as you churn out more content.
      </p>

      <h2>Why TikTok Posting is Not Part of My Marketing Strategy</h2>

      <p>
        In my orthodontic practice, posting to TikTok (or any social media channel) hasn't been a linchpin in our marketing strategy. Here's why:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li className="flex items-start space-x-3">
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-blue-100 flex items-center justify-center text-blue-600 font-bold"></div>
          <div>
            <strong>Limited Enjoyment of Social Media:</strong> I'll admit, I'm not a die-hard fan of social media. My less active presence on these platforms makes crafting successful posts more of a challenge.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li className="flex items-start space-x-3">
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-blue-100 flex items-center justify-center text-blue-600 font-bold"></div>
          <div>
            <strong>Unpredictable ROI and ROE:</strong> The return on investment and effort in organic posting can be a wild card. It's tough to predict how many new patients will walk through the door, and the whims of the algorithm can be unforgiving. Sometimes, despite putting in considerable effort, the return is disappointingly negligible.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li className="flex items-start space-x-3">
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-blue-100 flex items-center justify-center text-blue-600 font-bold"></div>
          <div>
            <strong>Lack of Entertaining Prowess:</strong> Let's face it—I'm not that entertaining. My marketing manager and I took a stab at TikTok content creation for a few months, and let's just say . . . <em>it wasn't a smash hit.</em>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Recognizing that this wasn't my forte, I opted not to pursue the strategy for an extended period.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>In the interest of full disclosure, I'm no organic TikTok content guru.</strong> If TikTok posting is your passion, I recommend studying the three accounts I mentioned earlier and extracting insights from their success.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you're curious about TikTok ads, which I happen to have considerable experience with, keep reading below…
      </p>

      <h2>What is a TikTok Ad?</h2>

      <p>
        A TikTok ad is a short video advertisement strategically placed on TikTok using the TikTok ads manager. Unlike the free-spirited journey of organic posts…
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>…with TikTok ads you invest your money to have TikTok deliver your ad to a specified audience.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the beauty of it: TikTok ads come with a set of controls. You decide who sees the content—ensuring it's exclusively showcased to people in the vicinity of your office, essentially reaching your ideal customer base with the highest chance of converting into patients.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that's not all. TikTok ads can have links or call-to-action buttons, enticing users to go off the platform and onto your website. <strong>It's the strategic nudge that guides potential patients from viewing your video to scheduling their new patient appointment.</strong>
      </p>

      <img

        alt="Ortho Boost Social Media Ad Templates" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <h2>Why Do I Prefer TikTok Ads?</h2>

      <p>
        The #1 reason I lean towards TikTok ads over posts is control. Here's why:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li className="flex items-start space-x-3">
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-blue-100 flex items-center justify-center text-blue-600 font-bold"></div>
          <div>
            <strong>Audience Control:</strong> With TikTok ads, I dictate who sees the content. No random algorithms here. My videos are tailored to reach my target demographic—people near my office, the ones most likely to become my patients.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li className="flex items-start space-x-3">
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-blue-100 flex items-center justify-center text-blue-600 font-bold"></div>
          <div>
            <strong>Assured Visibility:</strong> Unlike the uncertainty of organic posting, where the TikTok algorithm plays referee, TikTok ads guarantee visibility. I invest money, and I know people will actually see it—no guesswork, just a direct path to potential patients.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li className="flex items-start space-x-3">
          <div className="flex-shrink-0 w-6 h-6 rounded-full bg-blue-100 flex items-center justify-center text-blue-600 font-bold"></div>
          <div>
            <strong>Post-Viewing Experience:</strong> Crucially, I control what happens AFTER a user views my video. While TikTok posts leave it up to users to navigate to my office, TikTok ads guide them with a click, leading to a dedicated landing page answering their queries, introducing our office, and outlining the next steps they should take.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <img

        alt="Premier Orthodontics Template on a Laptop" 
        className="w-full rounded-xl my-8"
      />

      <p>
        Controlling these variables not only increases my chances of success…
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>…but also offers the option to amplify a successful ad by injecting more funds and reaping even more results.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>Plus, the beauty of TikTok ads is—I don't have to be the star of the show!</p>

      <p>
        I can outsource the video creation to TikTok ad creators, focusing solely on running the ads in the advertising account. <em>The success of my campaigns isn't tied to my ability to be entertaining!</em>
      </p>

      </p>

      <h2>How Much Do TikTok Ads Cost?</h2>

      <p>
        The entry fee for TikTok ads is a minimum daily budget of $50/day, totaling a minimum spend of $1500/month.
      </p>

      <p>
        But here's where it gets magical—with TikTok's pixel and tracking tools, you aren't blindly spending. You can calculate the cost per lead, cost per start, and actual production generated through your TikTok advertising.
      </p>

      <p>
        The real magic happens when you unearth a winning TikTok ad—one that generates more money than you spend on the ads. That's the cue to scale up, spending a dollar and getting back multiples in return.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the Return on Investment for TikTok Ads?</h2>

      <p>
        Navigating the realm of TikTok ads, like any advertising venture, involves risks and uncertainties. There's no guarantee of a return when you invest in TikTok ads…
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>…but with a strategic approach utilizing <a href="https://startorthoboost.com/blog/marketing-math-for-orthodontists/">marketing math</a> and a well-defined blueprint, you can significantly enhance your chances of success on the platform.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        In my own practice, I've been running TikTok ads for years, and in the current calendar year, I'm reaping a 9:1 ROI. For every dollar invested, I'm getting nine dollars back in production.
      </p>

      <p>
        Getting to this point required a journey—I had to master the art of creating TikTok ads that convert, fine-tune elements on my landing page, and ensure swift follow-ups with new leads.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The result?</em> A predictable marketing system that allows me to gauge, with a fair degree of accuracy, how many new patients we'll schedule based on the size of our ad budget.
      </p>
