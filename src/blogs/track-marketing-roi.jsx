      <h2>The ROI Dilemma</h2>
      <p>
        It's no secret that most orthodontic practices struggle with effectively tracking their ROI. Whether it's due to the complexity of marketing campaigns or a lack of streamlined tools, many practices find themselves making decisions based on assumptions rather than hard data. This leads to inefficient allocation of resources, wasted marketing dollars, and ultimately, a lack of substantial growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Enter ROI Tracking Software</h2>
      <p>
        ROI tracking software offers a comprehensive solution to the ROI dilemma. These software platforms, such as Go High Level and Infusionsoft, bring all your leads, campaigns, and patient interactions into one centralized dashboard. The result? A real-time snapshot of your marketing efforts, enabling you to make data-driven decisions that impact your practice's growth.
      </p>
