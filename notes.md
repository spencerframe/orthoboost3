I want to write blogs regularly. Please create a blog page that shows a list of all blogs (featured image, title, date, and 30 word snippet). When I click on the blog, I should view the blog with all it's content on a template page. The blogs should be structured so that there is a folder (blogs), and each componet inside of it is a separate blog that contains the body of the blog, as well as references to the freatured image, title, date, snippet and if it's published or not. If I add another component in this folder, it should appear in the blog page list.

Another meta data for each blog can be tags, so that I can filter the blogs by tag
